# MobileApp-Exportify

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a severe economic crisis. A twin economy is one in which domestic 
spending surpasses domestic revenue, placing it at risk of external debt and increasing its reliance on 
foreign capital flows. We therefore made the decision to create a platform where everyone may earn 
money while also contributing to the recovery of our nation from the current crisis.
Our primary objective with this mobile application is to create a global marketplace for small local 
business owners to sell their goods to consumers abroad, though local marketing is also available. Buyers 
and exporters are the app's users. Once registered, exporters can display their works and provide services 
to those who are interested in purchasing them. On the buyer's side, they can post a gig that details the 
good or service that needs to be performed. The application supports chat box functionality and the ability 
to make payments.
We put a lot of effort into making this program as efficient and user-friendly as possible so that anyone 
can use all the features without difficulty. For this development, the Kotlin programming language, 
Android Studio, and Firebase as the database are all used.
